      This is a 15-minute survey by researchers at Heidelberg University in Germany. You can only collect your reward if you complete the survey. To complete the survey, you have to answer <strong>all</strong> questions.
      <br><br>
      Please answer the questions to the best of your ability. Your opinion matters.
      <br><br>
      In the survey, a few tests have been included to ensure that your answers are consistent among each other. All hits failing the consistency test will be rejected.
      <br><br>
      If you complete the survey, you may be invited to a <strong>larger study</strong> in the future.
      <br><br>
      Thank you and enjoy your time here!
